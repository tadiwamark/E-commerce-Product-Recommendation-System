## Overview

This Streamlit app is designed to provide product recommendations based on historical sales data 
from an e-commerce platform. The app uses the FP-Growth algorithm to generate association rules, 
which help identify products that are frequently bought together. This information can be leveraged 
to anticipate customer needs and enhance their shopping experience.

## Features

* Interactive Analysis: Adjust parameters like minimum support and confidence to explore different association rules.
* Product Recommendations: Enter a set of products to receive recommendations on what other products could be added to the basket.
* Filtering Options: Filter association rules by specific products to focus on the relationships that matter most to you.

## Usage

After launching the app, follow these steps to explore product recommendations:

1. Adjust Parameters: Use the sliders to set the minimum support and confidence levels for the FP-Growth algorithm.
2. Generate Rules: Click the button to process the data and generate association rules.
3. Enter Products: Input products from your basket to see what other products are frequently bought together with them.
4. Download Rules: Download the generated rules as a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.
