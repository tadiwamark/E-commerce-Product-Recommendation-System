## Overview

This Streamlit app is designed to provide product recommendations based on historical sales data 
from an e-commerce platform. The app uses the FP-Growth algorithm to generate association rules, 
which help identify products that are frequently bought together. This information can be leveraged 
to anticipate customer needs and enhance their shopping experience.
